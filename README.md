# Hogarth_AR


This is a group project that uses unity to create a Augmented version of William Hogarthâ€™s Altarpiece that was originally placed in St Mary Redcliffe Church but is now located in St Nicholas Church in Bristol. The aim for this project is to allow people who visit the church to see the piece in Augemented reality.
